# Quest (Text Based Game in Python)

## Introduction

Quest will be a text based game where the player types their commands into a text prompt, and the system tells them the results.

They will be able to move from room to room, and interact with items and creatures.

There may even eventually be level building features.

I will be creating other files in this folder to gather notes, and will update this file as the design comes together.

For the purpose of game system elements we will use stats and concepts from the FluxRPG role playing game system. The current iteration of the system **[can be found here](https://publish.obsidian.md/cagoxmedia/FluxRPG/FluxRPG)**

## Files

1. [Character](./Character.md)
2. [Rooms](./Rooms.md)
3. [World](./World.md)

## Road Map

I foresee the following milestones. This may change as the project progresses of course.

1. ~~Initial Character implementation~~
2. ~~Initial room implementation.~~
3. ~~Initial Game Loop~~ and the ability to look at the room.
4. The ability to move between two rooms.
5. The World Grid. A map of rooms.
6. Items, and the ability to look at them and pick them up.
7. The ability to add challenges or locks on rooms.
8. More advanced map layout.
9. Map command or item.
10. multi-floor maps.
