# Quest

# Origin
I initially started on this project to create a tutorial for my son, so I was creating it piecemil.

I have since decided that it would be more effective for me to go ahead and create a proper version of program, and then build the tutorials from there, rather than the other way around.

I also suspect that people closer to my age will have a better appreciation for this kind of project.

# Installation
For the moment, installation is a matter of making sure python is installed, and downloading the code and running main.py. As the program developes to a point where that is no longer sufficient, I will update the information I have here.
